# UFOs

## Overview of Project

Dana is a Data Journalist and was given the assignment to write an article about her homestate of Oregon, within the context of UFO sightings. For Dana, it is an opportunity to visit back home and research on her favorite subject. Dana's hometown is famous for several UFO sightings, and has an annual UFo gathering in the townsquare. Dana has been interested in UFO since she was a little girl. For this assignment, she has a JavaScript data file that has information on UFO sightings, which include the date, city, state, country, shape, and a description of what occurred according to eye witnesses. Dana's plan is to transform the data in the JavaScript into a table with filters that can be easily understandable and analysed. Her goal is to post her article online and therefore she wanted put all her findings into a tidy use friendly HTML webpage.  

## Results and Findings

The HTML webpage is now fully functional with filters and several columns. Dana has configured the JavaScript files (data.js & app.js), css files (style.css) & HTML (index.html) in order to make the webpage come alive. 

In viewing the webpage, users can see that the Dana's short article on UFOs and get a space feel as the layout is organised to make users get a sense of what the webpage is all about

Users can view the webpage and see the different UFO sightings that occurred in 2010 and be able to filter by date, city, country, etc. For example, in Dana's homestate of Oregon, there were 3 UFO sightings within a span of 12 days and that lasted for few minutes. Another observation a user of the webpage can make is that the UFO sightings can last for as little a 1 second to several hours in some cases. Most of the UFO sightings occurred in a couple of minutes and are not long duration.


## Summary and conclusion

In summary, Dana's webpage on the existence of extra terraterral life forms on earth is evidenced by the several UFO sightings in January 2010 in North American cities, particularly the U.S. An observant user will want to explore more and delve into a more recent UFO sightings. He/She will have several questions such as. 'are there pictorial evidence of any of these UFO sightings?', 'what about other places around the world, outside of north america?', & 'what about eye witness interviews?'.
